    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was the first &ldquo;real&rdquo; work day here, without any intern specific activities, and also a Friday. When I arrived and parked in a spot in the back of the building, with my new babby laptop in tow, I really, for a brief moment, felt like a functioning member of society. I heroically scanned into the building using my incredibly and extremely fancy spider-man web-launcher style security card, only to become INSTANTLY lost in the maze that was the building. After eventually making my way to the Cube (and making a stop for a bagel in the break room)</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry your sweet eyes shall not be disappointed by today&rsquo;s entry, for I have MORE PICTURES.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/deku-scrub/blag/images/IMG_20140523_112111.jpg"></p>

<p>My manager met with me briefly before the day started to let me know that he would be sending me a couple of more resources on lvm and the like. He also dropped off not one, but two old desktop computers. We&rsquo;re talking like, 128MB ram on these pups. OH MAN I JUST REMEMBERED SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE TALKED ABOUT NOW AND NOT LATER.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/deku-scrub/blag/images/500004774-03-01.jpeg"></p>

<p>I went inside one of these server rooms yesterday and they are <em>really cool</em>. Also very loud. But I was shocked that they actually looked like this! Each rack has many shelves, and each shelf has a server. Then there are SO MANY of those racks. There were wires everywhere and fans running (hence the noise) for cooling. It was some SERIOUS business. It really gave me a sense of just what &ldquo;scalability&rdquo; means and why it&rsquo;s so important. Like, there were a LOT of computers here.</p>

<p>Okay, but those computers were nothing in comparison to my dinosaurs. Here are the specs, again in convenient table format.</p>

<p>[coming soon, I don&rsquo;t actually have those specs on hand right now. Gist-wise though, one had two 750GB drives, the other one 500GB drive]</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/deku-scrub/blag/images/IMG_20140523_112117.jpg"></p>

<p>The computers had some RHEL installs on them setup with virtual machines, but as per my manager&rsquo;s request, I pushed all of those aside and performed a fresh install of RHEL6. When doing this, I was also (obviously) allowed to select the way the disks looked. For the machine with two drives, I settled on the following layout:</p>

<p>Drive 1: 200mb /boot, remaining space RAID member 2
Drive 2: full RAID member 2</p>

<p>RAID: one logical volume group</p>

<p>volume group: 10GB logical volume for /, 4GB swap, 50GB logical volume for /home</p>

<p>You might think that&rsquo;s all boring, but it (should mean) that anything at all that happens to any of the volumes within the volume group would be completely synced across drives. That is, if one drive were to fail completely, all of the data would remain intact.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that it&rsquo;s between only two drives, that makes it just a simple RAID1 setup. Regardless, I put it to the test. While it was booted, I had a file open. I then ripped out one of the drives (as they are removable), performed a write, put the drive back in, waited for them to sync, and then ripped out the other one. Sure enough, the system was completely unaffected, as it should have been.</p>

<p>What this blog REALLY needs is more pictures of food. Lunch (cost money&hellip;) but was also pretty good. I had pretty much the above. The remainder of the day was spent reading up on some lvm docs that are totally confidential. <a href="/deku-scrub/blag/images/nope.txt">Just kidding</a>. But really, it wasn&rsquo;t all that interesting. What was pretty cool though, was later installing the RHEL7 release candidate on a new logical volume on my laptop. That&rsquo;s also confidential though. <a href="/deku-scrub/blag/images/nope.txt">OH ALSO JUST KIDDING. AGAIN</a>.</p>

<p>Not sure where this is going again. I&rsquo;ve lost perspective. Also scope. Last thing I&rsquo;d talk about is there&rsquo;s a package called <code>system-storage-manager</code> which is a pretty neat, (but still CLI) program to interface with lvm without needing to get down and dirty with lvm commands.</p>

<p>Yes, that is what I leave you with.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/deku-scrub/blag/images/IMG_20140521_090618.jpg"></p>

<p>They gave us these stickers, and this one left me confused. But don&rsquo;t worry, I texted it to my mom, and she was confused as well. I guess it&rsquo;s part of their &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to share &ndash; your mother was right&rdquo; campaign. Also, this photo came out pretty nice so that is why you are currently looking at it. I can&rsquo;t say the same about the next one cause it&rsquo;s a little blurry.</p>

<p>Thar she blows in all her beauty. The specs are below in a neat little table that hopefully will come out and not look awful:</p>

<p>Yeah, it has two batteries for some reason which was very confusing at first. Well, that&rsquo;s all the good news, but the bad news is that I will have to return it at the end of the internship :(. My poor baby.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get a little weird/interesting though: It turns out that, when they gave us the laptops, that they came installed with something called a &ldquo;RHEL6 CSB&rdquo;, which is the &ldquo;Red Hat Enterprise Linux Corporate Standard Build.&rdquo; Which actually, out of the box, does NOT have root or sudo access. Which, of course, means that you can&rsquo;t actually <em>install</em> anything. The person who gave us the laptops was very nice and expicilit in saying that we <em>could</em> in fact root them and install our own software on them, but I guess I was just taken aback.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/deku-scrub/blag/images/sandies.jpg"></p>

<p>After receiving the laptops and being taught how to log into our @redhat.com accounts (we have to use an authenticator to do so, which is kind of annoying), we proceeded to the manager lunch. This consisted primarily of triangular sandwiches. During the lunch, my manager told me that I should probably just wipe whatever&rsquo;s on the machines and load up either a non-CSB of RHEL or Fedora. After lunch, I was escorted to my cubicle by my manager and then, surprisingly, left to myself.</p>

<p>I signed onto IRC and joined all the channels that my manager advised I hang out in, and then got to work on the laptop. My official instructions were to read up about lvm (logical volume management) partitions. In particular, I was to read the RHEL7 instructions that were in development and ensure that they were accurate to what actually happened. In this pursuit though, I began to notice something. I was unable to install any packages still, even despite having given myself root through recovery mode. Apparently Fedora and Red Hat binaries aren&rsquo;t actually compatible? And of course, to install anything that wasn&rsquo;t a binary I&rsquo;d need a compiler but I couldn&rsquo;t fetch one of those either. Being a scrub, maybe one day I will figure out just what the problem was, but at the time I could not.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t entirely comfortable with the idea of completely wiping the CSB they had just provided me with. It was custom configured to connect to the Red Hat VPN in Raleigh, among other things. To combat this, I opened up the disk utility to check out the feasability of a dual boot. Much to my surprise, the disk was split up like this: 3GB for /dev/sda1 (this was mounted as /boot, which AFAIK is about 2.8GB more than it needs to be?), 253GB for /dev/sda2. Okay, that&rsquo;s not the surprising part. The 253GB partition was a logical volume group encrypted with LUKS. Inside of this, however, was a rather odd setup: 8GB for /home, 30GB for a blank directory mounted as /VirtualMachines, 8GB for /, 4GB for swap. And that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>Now, you may notice here, that 8+30+8+4 = 50GB / the 253GB partition. Where are the other 203GB? Unfortunately, the Disks utility wasn&rsquo;t telling me much, and gparted was telling me even less (no support for LUKS volumes).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/deku-scrub/blag/images/Sad-pug.jpg"></p>

<p>I was confused, but also conveniently had a list right next to me from my manager of lvm commands I could use to try to get to the bottom of the situation.</p>

<p>To list all the logical volumes (these are the things that are within the encrypted partition)
<code>
lvdisplay
</code></p>

<p>And information regarding the aforementioned volumes appeared, including their volume group name. In this case, the volume group name was RHELCSB6, (configured by the CSB).</p>

<p><code>
lvcreate --size 30GB RHELCSB6
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s <strong>it</strong>. It was really confusing to see how simple this was via CLI, but how compicated and unrepresentable it was in the included GUI tools.</p>

<p><code>
wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/20/Live/x86_64/Fedora-Live-Desktop-x86_64-20-1.iso
dd if=Fedora-Live-Desktop-x86_64-20-1.iso of=/dev/sdc bs=500M
</code></p>

<p>Where /dev/sdc is the usb device. The rest of the fedora process was straightforward, and the install also picked up the RHEL6 CSB install as long as it was mounted during the installation.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that I haven&rsquo;t mentioned here, including fiddling around with <code>lvremove</code>, <code>vgdisplay</code>, <code>lvrename</code>, and many more lv-, vg-, and pv tools. The way a lv (logical volume) builds on a vg (volume group) which builds on a pv (physical volume) seemed to, at least how I feel now, echo the networking stack, which is pretty interesting.</p>
